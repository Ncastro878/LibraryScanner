# LibraryScanner
Book Inventory App using barcode scanner.

This is one of my first projects that was primarily intended as a learning experience for Android Development. One of the first pieces of advice I read for learning to program was to build something you would find useful. Owning 200+ books I thought it'd be nice to take a personal inventory of them in a fast and seamless way. Going from idea to implementation is a very cool experience. 

Tools/Concepts/Libraries used and learned while building this:

- MVP Design Pattern

- XML Parsing

- AsyncTask

- NetworkCalls ( HttpUrlConnection() )

- MySQLite database

- Recyclerview
